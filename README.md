# Formula-Evaluation
the fourth assignment for CS 2110: Objective Oriented Programming and Data Structures.
Wrote an application that evaluates postfix formulas in spreadsheets saved in CSV format. Also developed an interactive calculator to help build intuition for the data structures involved in class. 
Some key processes involve:
1 Leverage subtype polymorphism to represent expression trees containing multiple kinds of nodes.
2 Process tree data structures recursively.
3 Report and respond to failed operations using exceptions.
4 Write tests for methods expected to throw exceptions using lambda expressions.
