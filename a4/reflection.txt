## Reflection questions

1. What part of the assignment did you find the trickiest to understand or get working?
   Was there a particular insight or diagnostic technique that lead to a breakthrough?

   Answer: I found the part of CsvEvaluator(evaluateCsv function) really trickiest to get working, especially
  with the replacement of the cell's coordinates/"NA." I am still working on it to try to get a solution
  using enhanced for-loop
